## üìÇ Project Structure
- **Dataset**: LGG MRI Segmentation dataset from Kaggle (`mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation`)
- **Code**: `medical_seg.py` (included in the repository)
  - Data preprocessing and loading
  - Model definition and training
  - Visualization of MRI scans, masks, and segmentation results
  - Evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)
- **Outputs**:
  - Trained model weights: `clf-resnet-weights.keras`
  - Model architecture: `clf-resnet-model.json`
  - Visualizations: Plots for mask distribution, training curves, and segmentation overlays

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.x
   - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Access to Google Colab or a local environment with GPU support (recommended)

2. **Dataset**:
   - Download the LGG MRI Segmentation dataset via Kaggle API:
     ```bash
     import kagglehub
     mateuszbuda_lgg_mri_segmentation_path = kagglehub.dataset_download('mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation')
     ```
   - Ensure the dataset is placed in the working directory or update paths in the script.

3. **Run the Code**:
   - Execute `medical_seg.py` in Google Colab or a local Jupyter environment.
   - The script handles:
     - Data loading and preprocessing
     - Model training with ResNet50
     - Visualization of results
     - Saving the model and weights

4. **View Results**:
   - Check generated plots for data distribution, training metrics, and segmentation visualizations.
   - Evaluate model performance using the test set metrics.

## üìà Visualizations
- **Mask Distribution**: Bar plot showing the count of positive (tumor) and negative (no tumor) cases.
- **Training Curves**: Loss and accuracy plots for training and validation phases.
- **Segmentation Results**: Side-by-side visualizations of MRI scans, masks, and tumor overlays.

## üí° Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Sorting and pairing MRI images with corresponding masks, handling class imbalance.
- **Model Architecture**: Transfer learning with ResNet50, fine-tuned for binary classification (tumor vs. no tumor).
- **Training**: Early stopping, learning rate reduction, and model checkpointing to optimize performance.
- **Evaluation**: Comprehensive metrics including accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## üåü Future Improvements
- Experiment with advanced segmentation architectures (e.g., U-Net, Mask R-CNN).
- Incorporate multi-modal MRI data (e.g., FLAIR, T1, T2 sequences).
- Enhance model robustness with additional data augmentation techniques.
- Deploy the model as an API for real-time inference in clinical settings.
